        We love picky eaters. We love foodies. We love vegetarians. We love
        health freaks. “Is there any dessert?” We love them too. We love the
        ones who call. We even love the ones who order online. We love them all.
        “Discover your next healthy dish” Born with a mission to revolutionize
        eating habits, we believe in providing tiffins in Mumbai that are
        healthy, homely and hygienic. These meals are ideal for people who are
        too busy to cook or don’t wish to compromise on nutrition with
        restaurant food. The menu, at Yummy Tiffins, comes in a variety of
        mouth-watering cuisines and nutritional options- a judicious mix of
        carbohydrates and proteins, low calorie content and no artificial
        flavours/preservatives. Whether it’s Hakka noodles, Cheese Balls or
        Gulab Jamun. Nutrition doesn’t have to mean bland, boring diets. Ask the
        dietician on board. It’s just like you would make it, minus the effort.
        The team at Yummy Tiffins ensures that the meals are not only healthy
        but also appealing to the eye and palette. We believe in giving
        surprises and breaking monotony, so our menu changes daily and features
        over 40 dishes that change every day. That includes a variety of
        vegetables, daal, soups, raita, rice, rotis, salads, and snack items.
        These are healthy, well-balanced meals cooked in rice bran/olive oil,
        which provide the right amount of protein along with essential vitamins
        and minerals. The same food prepared in canteens or Udupi restaurants
        can be tasty, but is generally oily and big on your pocket. Yummy
        Tiffins also offers different meal plans, such as, diabetic meal,
        low/medium calorie meals, and meals for those who want to put on weight.
        This means, you can build your own healthy tiffin or choose from 10-12
        combo schemes. Now, relish the tangy vegetable masala, homemade
        GajarHalwa, and life-changing Garlic Spinach and Chickpea soup. Go on,
        order as you are.
